# Foreground-Background-seperation
The provided MATLAB code demonstrates a basic implementation of foreground-background separation for images. The goal of the code is to segment a distinct foreground object from its background in an image. This is achieved through a series of image processing steps, including grayscale conversion, adaptive thresholding, and morphological operations. The code showcases the original input image, the binary foreground mask, and the resulting image with the separated foreground object displayed alongside each other. The approach is suitable for images with clear object-background contrast, uniform lighting conditions, and relatively simple backgrounds. However, more advanced techniques may be necessary for complex scenes with dynamic elements or challenging lighting conditions.
